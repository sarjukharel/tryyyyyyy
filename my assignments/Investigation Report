  <h1>INVESTIGATION REPORT</h1>
  <p><strong>Sarju Kharel (2417701)</strong></p>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This report checks if three people are real or fake based on online information.</p>

  <div class="person">
    <h2>1. Pieter Mouthaan</h2>
    <p>
      Pieter Mouthaan claims to be a developer and entrepreneur from the Netherlands, known for creating Photo AI.
      However, historical records only show a Pieter Mouthaan born in 1836 and another in 1859 in Gravenmoer,
      Netherlands—both from the 19th century, making them unlikely to be the modern developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, a company called WeSmile, based in Eindhoven, Netherlands, focuses on AI photobooths. Its
      co-founders are Yap Yung Hui and Juliusz Dokrzewski, but there is no mention of Pieter Mouthaan.
    </p>
    <p class="conclusion">
      There is no current information confirming the existence of a modern developer named Pieter Mouthaan linked to Photo AI.
      This raises doubts about the authenticity of this identity.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="person">
    <h2>2. Michael Moore</h2>
    <p><strong>Claimed Identity:</strong> A business owner in Manhattan, widower with family in Spain, and owner of a German Shepherd named Jack.</p>
    <p>
      A search for “Michael Moore business owner Manhattan widower family in Spain German Shepherd Jack” only showed
      results for the well-known filmmaker Michael Moore, who does not match this description.
    </p>
    <p>
      No reliable information, such as a LinkedIn profile, business website, or news article, was found to confirm this identity.
    </p>
    <p class="conclusion">
      Since no specific or matching online information was found, it is likely that this Michael Moore's identity is either false or misrepresented.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="person">
    <h2>3. Kenneth Dean</h2>
    <p><strong>Claimed Identity:</strong> Vice President in real estate, living in Washington, D.C.</p>
    <p>
      No reliable information confirms that Kenneth Dean holds a VP position in real estate in Washington, D.C.
      A search for “Kenneth Dean VP real estate Washington, D.C.” brought up some professional profiles, including one
      listing him as an IT Administrator for S.C. Herman & Associates in Washington, D.C.
    </p>
    <p class="conclusion">
      There is no clear evidence linking Kenneth Dean to a Vice President role in real estate in Washington, D.C but includes at least one verifiable profile suggesting he is a real person.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Overall Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    After searching online, it seems likely that Pieter Mouthaan is not real, as his name is linked to AI-generated scams.
    Michael Moore has very little online information, making it hard to confirm if he exists.
    Kenneth Dean appears to be the most credible since there are some references to him, but there is still not enough solid proof about his background.
  </p>
  <p>
    This research shows why it’s important to verify online identities. Many scammers create fake profiles to trick people,
    so it’s always best to check sources and find real evidence before trusting someone online.
